<p>Partition table manipulator for Darwin UFS/HFS/DOS. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      fdisk [-ieu] [-f <i>mbrname</i>] [-c <i>cylinders</i>] [-h <i>heads</i>] [-s <i>sectors</i>] [-S <i>size</i>] [-b <i>size</i>] <i>disc</i>

Options
     -i       Initialize the MBR sector.

     -a <i>style</i>
              Specify an automatic partitioning style.

     -e       Edit existing MBR sectors.

     -y       Do not ask for confirmation before writing.

     -d       Dump partition table in a format readable by the -r option.

     -r       Read a partition table from the standard input.

     -t       Test if the disk is partitioned.

     -c <i>cylinders</i>, -h <i>heads</i>, -s <i>sectors</i>
              Specify an alternate BIOS geometry for fdisk to use.

     <i>disk</i>     The disk in the form /dev/rdisk0.

     The <b>DOS fdisk </b>program can be used to divide space on the disk into parti-
     tions and set one active.  This <b>fdisk</b> program serves a similar purpose to
     the DOS program.  When called with no special flags, it prints the MBR
     partition table of the specified device, i.e.,

   # fdisk fd0
   Disk: fd0   geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
   Offset: 0   Signature: 0xAA55
      Starting    Ending
    #: id   cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd  sec [start - size]
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   *1: A6     0   0   1 -   79   1   18 [   0 -  2880] OpenBSD
    2: 00     0   0   0 -    0   0    0 [   0 -     0] unused
    3: A7     0   0   2 -   79   1   18 [   1 -  2879] NEXTSTEP
    4: 00     0   0   0 -    0   0    0 [   0 -     0] unused

     The geometry displayed is a synthetic geometry unless another geometry
     has been selected using the -c, -h, and -s options.  In the future, fdisk
     will read the BIOS geometry from the IOKit registry.

     In this example, the disk is divided into two partitions that happen to
     fill the disk.  The first partition overlaps the third partition.  (Used
     for debugging purposes.)

     #     Number of partition table entry.  A `*' denotes the
     bootable partition.

     id     System identifier.  OpenBSD reserves the magic number 166
     decimal (A6 in hex).  If no 166 partition is found, it will
     use an older FreeBSD partition (with a magic number of 165 or
     A5 in hex).

     cyl/hd/sec   These fields provide the starting and ending address of the
     partition in BIOS geometry

     start/size   These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors
     of the partition in linear block addresses.

     NOTE: The sectors field is `1 based', and the start field is `0
     based'.  The CHS values might need to be in the BIOS's geometry for older
     systems to be able to boot and use the drive correctly; most modern sys-
     tems prefer the starting sector and size in preference to the CHS values.

     The -i flag is used to indicate that the partition data is to be initial-
     ized.  In this mode, fdisk will completely overwrite the primary MBR and
     partition table, either using the default MBR template, or the one speci-
     fied by the -f flag.

     In the default template, partition number 1 will be configured as a Dar-
     win boot partition spanning from cylinder 0, head 1, sector 1, and
     extending for 8 megabytes.   Partition number 2 will be configured as a
     Darwin HFS partition spanning the rest of the disk.  This mode is
     designed to initialize an MBR the very first time, or when it has been
     corrupted beyond repair.

     You can specify other default partition styles with the -a flag.  The
     available styles are:

     boothfs   Creates an 8Mb boot partition (type AB hex) and makes the
     rest of the disk a Darwin HFS partition (type AF hex).

     bootufs   Creates an 8Mb boot partition (type AB hex) and makes the
     rest of the disk a Darwin UFS partition (type A8 hex).

     hfs   Makes the entire disk one Darwin UFS partition (type A8 hex).

     ufs   Makes the entire disk one HFS+ partition (type AF hex).

     dos   Makes the entire disk one DOS partition (type 0C hex).

     raid   Makes the entire disk one type AC hex partition.

     The -u flag is used to update the MBR code on a given drive.  The MBR
     code extends from offset 0x000 to the start of the partition table at
     offset 0x1BE.  It is similar to the -i flag, except the existing parti-
     tion table is preserved. This is useful for writing new MBR code onto an
     existing drive, and is equivalent to the DOS command `FDISK /MBR'.
     Note that this option will overwrite the NT disk signature, if present.
     The -u and -i flags can not be specified together.

     The flag -e is used to modify a partition table using a interactive edit
     mode of the fdisk program.   This mode is designed to allow you to change
     any partition on the drive you choose, including extended partitions.  It
     is a very powerful mode, but is safe as long as you do not execute the
     write command, or answer in the negative (the default) when fdisk asks
     you about writing out changes.

COMMAND MODE

     When you first enter this mode, you are presented with a prompt, that
     looks like so: fdisk: 0>.  This prompt has two important pieces of infor-
     mation for you.  It will tell you if the in-memory copy of the boot block
     has been modified or not.  If it has been modified, the prompt will
     change to look like: fdisk:*0>.  The second piece of information pertains
     to the number given in the prompt.   This number specifies the disk offset
     of the currently selected boot block you are editing.  This number could
     be something different that zero when you are editing extended parti-
     tions.  The list of commands and their explanations are given below.

     help    Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive
              edit mode.

     manual  Display this manual page.

     reinit  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot block.

     auto    Partition the disk with one of the automatic partition styles.

     disk    Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed.  You
             are given a chance to edit it if you wish.

     edit    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot
             block.  You can edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector
             offsets and sizes.

     setpid  Change the partition identifier of the given partition table
             entry.  This command is particularly useful for reassigning an
             existing partition to OpenBSD.

     flag    Make the given partition table entry bootable.  Only one entry
             can be marked bootable.  If you wish to boot from an extended
             partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for
             the extended partition as bootable.

     update  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently
             selected boot block.  Note that this option will overwrite the NT
             disk signature, if present.

     select  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by the
             extended partition table entry in the current boot block.

     print   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block and
             its MBR table to the terminal.

     write   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk.  You will be
             asked to confirm this operation.

     exit    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously
             selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
             program if there is none.

     quit    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously
             selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
             program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified
             block out.

     abort   Quit program without saving current changes.</pre>
<p>In order for the BIOS to boot the kernel, certain conventions must be adhered 
  to. Sector 0 of a bootable hard disk must contain boot code, an MBR partition 
  table, and a magic number (0xAA55). These MBR partitions (also known as BIOS 
  partitions) can be used to break the disk up into several pieces. The BIOS loads 
  sector 0 of the boot disk into memory, verifies the magic number, and begins 
  executing the code at the first byte. The normal DOS MBR boot code searches 
  the MBR partition table for an ``active'' partition (indicated by a `*' in 
  the first column), and if one is found, the boot block from that partition is 
  loaded and executed in place of the original (MBR) boot block.</p>
<p> The automatic calculation of starting cylinder etc. uses a set 
  of figures that represent what the BIOS thinks is the geometry of the drive.  
  These figures are by default taken from the in-core disklabel, or values that 
  /boot has passed to the kernel, but fdisk gives you an opportunity to change 
  them if there is a need to. This allows the user to create a bootblock that 
  can work with drives that use geometry translation under a potentially different 
BIOS. </p>
<p>If you hand craft your disk layout, please make sure that the 
  OpenBSD partition starts on a cylinder boundary. (This restriction might be changed 
  in the future.) </p>
<p>Editing an existing partition is risky, and can cause you to lose 
  all the data in that partition. </p>
<p>You should run this program interactively once or twice to see 
  how it works. This is completely safe as long as you answer the `write' questions 
  in the negative.</p>
<p>There are subtleties fdisk detects that are not explained in this 
  manual page. As well, chances are that some of the subtleties it should detect 
  are being steamrolled. Caveat Emptor.</p>
